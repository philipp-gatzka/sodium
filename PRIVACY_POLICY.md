# Privacy Policy for Sodium Recipe App

**Last Updated:** December 23, 2024

## Introduction

Sodium ("we", "our", or "the app") is a recipe management application. This privacy policy explains how we handle your information when you use our mobile application.

## Summary

**Your privacy is simple with Sodium:**
- All your data stays on your device
- We don't collect any personal information
- We don't track you or use analytics
- We don't share anything with anyone

## Information Collection

### What We Collect

**Nothing.** Sodium does not collect, transmit, or store any of your personal information on external servers.

### What You Store Locally

The app stores the following data **only on your device**:
- Recipe titles and descriptions
- Ingredients and instructions
- Cooking times and serving sizes
- Recipe categories and favorites
- App preferences (theme settings)

This data is stored using Isar, a local database that keeps everything on your device.

## Data Storage

All data created within Sodium is stored locally on your device using the Isar embedded database. This means:

- Your recipes never leave your device automatically
- No cloud synchronization occurs
- No data is transmitted to external servers
- You have complete control over your data

### Data Location

On Android, data is stored in the app's private storage directory, which is not accessible to other apps.

## Data Sharing

**We do not share your data with anyone.**

- No third-party analytics services
- No advertising networks
- No data brokers
- No social media integration that shares your data

### Export Feature

The app includes an export feature that allows you to manually share your recipes. When you use this feature:
- You choose when and how to share
- Data is only shared through your device's share sheet
- We have no access to exported data

## Permissions

Sodium requests minimal permissions:

| Permission | Purpose | Required |
|------------|---------|----------|
| Storage (if applicable) | To export recipe files | Only when exporting |

We do not request access to:
- Camera
- Microphone
- Location
- Contacts
- Phone

## Children's Privacy

Sodium does not knowingly collect any information from children under the age of 13. The app is a simple recipe manager with no data collection, making it safe for users of all ages.

## Security

Since all data is stored locally on your device:
- Data security depends on your device's security
- We recommend using device lock (PIN, fingerprint, face ID)
- Uninstalling the app will delete all stored recipes
- We recommend using the export feature for backups

## Your Rights

You have complete control over your data:

- **Access:** View all your data within the app
- **Export:** Use the export feature to get a copy of all recipes
- **Delete:** Remove individual recipes or uninstall the app to delete all data
- **Modify:** Edit any recipe at any time

## Changes to This Policy

We may update this privacy policy from time to time. Changes will be reflected in the "Last Updated" date at the top of this document.

Since we don't collect contact information, we cannot notify you directly of changes. We recommend checking this policy periodically.
